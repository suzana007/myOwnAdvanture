     <p>Title: Suzana_Selfie_1200x1200 px</p>
     <p>Semester/Year:Fall 2019</p>
    <p>Software: Photoshop</p>
     <p>Description: I choose two images. One is my selfie and another one is nature which represents myself and my hobby. Nature represents traveling. I love to travel around and capture the beautiful nature and share them with the world. The most challenging part was to make the picture (1200px* 1200px). The professor helped me with that.</p>
