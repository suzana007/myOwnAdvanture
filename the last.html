      <p>Title: AFTER FX ANIMATION</p>
       <p>Semester/Year: Fall 2019</p>
      <p>Software: After Effects</p>
      <p>Description: I decided to make a text animation that can be used as an ad for a photographer. I also add some pictures that the photographer took. I choose the color dark blue and orange because the dark blue is the photographerâ€™s favorite color and the opposite color of blue is orange which makes the text animation more bright to see. Also, I added a sound effect which makes the animation more meaningful. This took me longer because I added some extra effects, solids, text in the animation. The most challenging part was the animation was deleted when I was in the halfway. I had to start it again. I downloaded sound effects from youtube. Choosing a sound effect was 2nd most challenging part because I had to make sure that the sound matches with my animation. Also, the professor helped me to export the animation.</p>
