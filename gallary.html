    <p>Title: Suzana_Audio_clip</p>
    <p>Semester/Year: Fall 2019</p>
    <p>Software: Audacity</p>
    <p>I decided to decipt my story in a place where I was stuck because it was raining and thunder storming. I was all alone and the story so on. I combined 6 clips to make my audio clip. I used amplify effect to change the amplitude of the clip. The most challenging part was to organize all the clips perfectly. Also changing the amplitude was complicated. I took help from the professor and she explained every single options to edit. I used freesound.org to collect the clips.</p>
